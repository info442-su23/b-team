## Problem
Food waste in the household is leaving a carbon footprint on the environment and causes food insecurity. In the United States, 38% of all food in 2021 went unsold or uneaten - most of that goes to landfill (ReFED, 2023). That's almost 149 billion meals' worth of food wasted. The food that ends up in landfills generates 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is the root cause of climate change today (Climate Portal, 2023). Reducing and preventing food waste can increase food security, promote resource and energy conservation, and address climate change.

Many consumers often misunderstand date labels, throwing away perfectly good food before it's spoiled. This food could have been donated to a local food bank or composted. Currently, one solution is to inform individuals to reduce food waste by carefully planning out their purchases to prevent overbuying. Of course, consumers find that changing their behavior for the sake of reducing waste is difficult when they don’t see the direct positive effects. This is why we want to create a new solution to educate the youth for the future of grocery shoppers on sustainable shopping and proper food storage and management to reduce food waste. 

Another approach has been changing the lunchroom layout. “Cornell’s Smarter Lunchroom Movement found that simply shifting the placement of items in the cafeteria and displaying creative names for vegetables—like “X-ray Vision Carrots” and “Super Strength Spinach”—led to dramatically more produce eaten” (SFW, 2016). While this has been a contributing factor it is not enough to solve the food waste crisis. Currently, there’s a lack of classes regarding sustainable living and  environmental conservation with in the middle school curriculum. These students are not armed with the right knowledge on how to properly manage food storage and we need to do more to address this issue.

## Solution Summary
Solution Summary. Briefly, summarize how the product described below will help solve the stated problem. This should be about one paragraph.


As for the solution, we believe the greatest issue is the lack of acknowledgment of food waste. Many individuals are unaware of the immense amount of wastage that happens when it comes to food waste. Through the use of our app, we are able to bring awareness of the shear amount of food waste along with solutions on how individuals can reduce their amount of waste, whether that be through the use of games or quizzes. Our end goal is to spark change and awareness in the youth through interactive games and activities.

###
###
###### Wireframe #1 - Landing Page
The app will greet the user with this first wireframe representing the landing page. Here, the name of the app will be the biggest, and the slogan for the app will be right underneath it. Include a large and contrasting button to start playing the game. Include an arrow on the button to insinuate that clicking it will lead to the next page. Add graphics that relate to plants later in development. The button is the only selectable element here, so it must work and lead to wireframe #2.

###### Wireframe #2 - Instructions
This frame will be a basic outline of instructions about our site. We want the instructions to be simple but straightforward. There should be a back button on every screen except frame #1 so the user can go back if they desire. Include a large next button at the bottom with an arrow to show flow. Next button must link to next page, wireframe #3 Seed Demo. 

###### Wireframe #3 - Seed Demo
The Seed Demo wireframe #3 will be a brief introduction to how the plant aspect of the game works. Show 3 stages of a plant with the energy points bar updated accordingly. Include text above to show how the game works, and then on bottom, include text that outlines how you “win”. Next button will link to wireframe #4.


###### Wireframe #4 - Menu Demo
This frame will give a brief overview of how the menu bar works. The menu bar should have a home button that always links to the home page (wireframe #6). This menu bar will be at the top of each screen going forward (except wireframe #5). The Garden button at the top will link to wireframe #11 showing the garden and completed plants. The games button will link to wireframe #13 Game Page. This is where users will be able to select from 3 options and earn points towards their plant. The DIY links to the unlocked DIY project wireframe #26. The top right corner of every screen should include the plants status bar. This bar must update as the user gains points towards their plant, to reflect how grown it is. The next button at the bottom leads to wireframe #5 Seed Selection. 


###### Wireframe #5 - Seed Selection
This frame lists the types of seeds the user can choose to grow. On this page, the user should be able to select one of the unlocked seeds. If the seed is selected, the white box should react to appear selected. The user can only select from the unlocked seeds. Once they are ready to begin, and have a seed selected, they can press the start button. If the user has nothing selected, the start button should not be selectable. The user can only select one seed, there should be no way for the user to select more than one. The locked seeds should have a slash through them or be faded in color to show that they are unselectable. At the top of the page, the user should see the logo and then be prompted to select a seed. Each category of difficulty is separated by a white line. 

###### Wireframe #6 - Home Page
This frame will be the standard home screen. Here, there should be a large box with the status of the seed growth displayed. The status bar will be located underneath the seed so the user can see how much they have grown. The text to the right of this box should relay what percentage the user is at. It should also invite the user to play more games and earn more points. The sun on this page should not be selectable unless it is yellow and the bar is full. 

###### Wireframe #7 - Home Page - seed at 50%
This frame is the same as #6 but is updated to show the plant at a different growing stage. This page should always reflect the percentage grown by updating the text to the right of the image, updating the image to reflect a new stage of growth, and update the energy bar under the image to show the percentage grown. 

###### Wireframe #8 - Home Page - seed at 100%
This frame is the same as #6 and #7 but represents the plant at a fully grown level. Here, the image will be updated to show the fully grown plant, the text to the right should reflect that the user has hit 100% growth and then should prompt the user to click the sun to unlock a new DIY project. The user should be able to select the yellow sun which will lead to frame #9.

###### Wireframe #9 - Home Page - DIY Unlocked
This frame shows the DIY that is unlocked and added to the DIY library. There should be a sun icon that is followed by the words “NEW DIY UNLOCKED”. There should be a box that pops up that is labeled with the new DIY title and it’s corresponding image. There should also be a small popup that tells the user to navigate to the DIY page if they want to explore the DIY further. The user can press the next button on the bottom right of the screen to return to wireframe #10.

###### Wireframe #10 - Home Page - Plant done and unlocked, choose new seed
This frame will reflect the fact that the user has fully completed the plant. If the DIY has been unlocked already (wireframe #9), then this page will prompt the user to click the seeds button to select a new plant to grow. There should be text outlining what the user should do here. Pressing the seeds button should bring the user to wireframe #4. The user can not select the same seed or one they have already fully grown. If the user unlocks all seeds in a difficulty category, they should have the ability to now select from the next level up. 

###### Wireframe #11 - Garden Page Empty
This frame can be accessed by selecting the Garden menu button. If the user has completed no plants, the garden will be empty. The text should relay this as well. 

###### Wireframe #12 - Garden Page - Tomato

This frame shows what would happen if a user has finished a tomato plant. The garden should now show an image of the plant, and relay the number of fully grown plants. If the garden has more than 3 plants finished, the box will be full. The game should automatically produce a second planter box that can be accessed by an arrow next to the first box.

###### Wireframe #13 - Game Page
This frame can only be accessed by selecting the Games tab in the top menu bar. Here, there should be text that prompts the user to select a game. Each game will be displayed as a box with an image inside. Each box should have a title for the game below it. There should be one for quiz, quest and sort. There should also be text at the bottom of the page that says Earn energy points! All 3 boxes should be selectable and link to the appropriate frame to begin the game. 

###### Wireframe #14 - Quiz Instructions
This frame can be accessed if the user clicks on the quiz icon box on frame #13. This will give a brief description of the game to the user and also include a button that says start. Pressing this will start the game and lead to wireframe #15.

###### Wireframe #15 - Quiz Question 1
This frame shows what a quiz question will look like. There should be text that highlights the number of questions there are and which one the user is on. The quiz question will be pasted, along with 4 ovals that represent the 4 options the user can choose from. If the user selects a button, and they can only select one at a time, the button will fill with an outline stroke or some indicator that they have selected that answer. When the user is ready to see if they choose correctly, they will press the submit button, that is located at the bottom of the screen, very large so it is evident. 

###### Wireframe #16 - Quiz Question 1 Correct
This frame appears after a user submits a question. If they choose correct, there will be text that says correct, and then a blurb about the fact. The 4 options will also appear, with the correct one highlighted and the other options, gray so it’s clear which answer is correct. Aside from the top menu bar, the user only has the ability to select the button located on the bottom right of the screen that leads them to question 2 (which will look like frame #15, with a new question and updated count of the game status). 

###### Wireframe #17 - Quiz Question 1 Incorrect
This frame is the same as the previous, but shows what the frame would look like if the user was incorrect, the only change would be the word INCORRECT instead of correct. Make sure to include the same button that links to the next question as shown above. 

###### Wireframe #18 - Quiz Question Score
Once the quiz has been completed, this frame should appear. It should show a congrats message, with the number of questions the user scored right out of 5. Depending on the number of questions correct, the user should receive the following points:

There should also be a box that represents the amount of energy points earned, with the sun icon. The top energy bar should adjust and fill based off of the number of points earned. The user can go back to the list of games by clicking the button on the bottom right - it will lead back to wireframe #13. 

###### Wireframe #19 - Quest Instructions
If the user selects the quest icon on frame #13, this frame should appear. Here, the page displays the objective of the quest, as stated in the text. There is only one button thats able to be selected, the start button, this leads to frame #20. 

###### Wireframe #20 - Quest Prompts
This frame shows the different quests available for the type of plant. Quests correspond to the specific seed the user is working on growing. Here, the quests are laid out in order, with a different task for each. If the user has done a task, they have the option to select the white box to the left of each quest. If a box is selected the user will see a check appear in the box. The user can select as many boxes as they please, and to update the status and receive points, the user should press submit. Submit can not be pressed unless there is at least one box selected. 

###### Wireframe #21 - Quest Complete
Once the user submits their completed quests, the screen will display a message congratulating them on their accomplishments. The user should receive 10 points per completed task. There will also be the sun icon that alots the number of earned points, and the energy bar in the top right corner should adjust as well. The user can press the back to games button once they are done, and they will be led back to frame #13.

###### Wireframe #22 - Sort Instructions

###### Wireframe #23 - Sort Game
This frame represents the sort game in action. The top should display the item they are on out of 5, and there should be text to the left of the bins with the appropriate prompt and item to be sorted. The user then clicks the can they think the item should be disposed of in. They can only select one bin. The bin selected will have an outline to make it clear which one is selected. Once the user is confident in their choice they will be able to hit submit. 

###### Wireframe #24 - Sort Game Correct
Once the user hits submit, this frame will appear, letting the user know whether or not they got the question correct. If they did it will say correct and then also provide a fact related to the bin. The only difference is that if they are incorrect, the text will relay that. Once they are ready for the next question they can hit the next button at the bottom right.

###### Wireframe #25 - Sort Game Complete
Once the user has made their way through all 5 sort questions, the user frame will show a congratulations message with the amount of points they earned:

The status bar at the top right corner should update to reflect their energy progress. The user can go back to the games frame #13 by clicking on the bottom right button that is labeled to do this. 

###### Wireframe #26 - DIY
This frame appears when the user selects the DIY tab of the top menu bar. Here, the unlocked projects will appear, in this case, only one is available. Each project will be a box with it’s title and icon. To open a project, simply click the icon button. In this case, the user can select the DIY1: Compost Bin square to access wireframe #27.

###### Wireframe #27 - DIY - Compost Bin
This frame is an example of an opened DIY project. Here, the icon is in the upper left hand corner. There should be a list of items needed for the project, as well as a step by step tutorial with matching images.
