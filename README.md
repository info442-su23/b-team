Mission Statement: Decrease food waste by informing the youth

Problem Statement: Food waste is leaving a carbon footprint on the environment and causes food insecurity. In the United States, 38% of all food in 2021 went unsold or uneaten - most of that goes to landfill (ReFED). That's almost 149 billion meals' worth of food wasted. The food that ends up in landfills generate 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is the root cause of climate change today (Climate Portal, 2023). Nearly half of that surplus food ends up in our homes meaning that there is a knowledge gap in how consumers could reduce and store perishables properly.

Many consumers can misunderstand date labels, throwing perfectly good food away before it's spoiled. This food could have been donated to a local food bank or composted. Currently, one solution is to inform individuals to reduce food waste by carefully planning out their purchases to prevent overbuying. Of course, consumers will find changing their behavior for the sake of  reducing waste to be difficult. Aligning with UN Goal 12, the real challenge is how to educate grocery spenders on sustainable shopping and proper food storage and management. 

Currently, there’s a lack of classes regarding sustainable living and  environmental conservation with in the middle school curriculum. These students are not armed with the right knowledge on how to properly manage food storage.
